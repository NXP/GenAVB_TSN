Build
-----
GenAVB/TSN is using Cmake to generate build system.

Some preliminary configuration is required to provide path to the toolchain,
staging directory and external components.

Local configuration files can be included by the build system in order to
to define some variables specific to the developer environment.
The local config file name is `./local_config_${target}.cmake`


Build requirements
------------------
- Linux host system and development tools (git, make, doxygen for the docs, ...)
- An ARM gcc toolchain is sufficient for the stack. However building the linux
applications requires a more complete cross-compilation SDK (because of
additional dependencies such as alsa and gstreamer).
- AVB endpoint builds depend on custom changes to the Linux kernel and specific Yocto distribution: https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/real-time-edge-software:REALTIME-EDGE-SOFTWARE
- FreeRTOS builds require additional MCUXpresso SDK software: https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/wired-communications-middleware-for-nxp-microcontrollers:WIRED-COMM-MIDDLEWARE?fpsp=1&#avb-tsn
- Zephyr builds require the usage of an [RTOS abstraction layer](https://github.com/NXP/rtos-abstraction-layer) and additional NXP software. Refer to [Harpoon Software](https://github.com/NXP/harpoon-apps) for reference.

### FreeRTOS
Currently GenAVB/TSN stack support only ARM gcc toolchain for FreeRTOS targets.
To be able to build the stack, ARMGCC_DIR environment variable pointing
to arm-gcc toolchain must be defined.
```
export ARMGCC_DIR=/path/to/gcc-arm-none-eabi-xxx
```

The local config file should define:
```
set(MCUX_SDK "/path/to/freertos_MCUXpresso_SDK" CACHE PATH "Path to MCUXpresso SDK")
set(RTOS_APPS "/path/to/freertos_application" CACHE PATH "Path to FreeRTOS application repository")
```

### Zephyr
The GenAVB/TSN stack can be built as a Cmake subdirectory of a top level Zephyr application
Refer to [Harpoon Software](https://github.com/NXP/harpoon-apps) for an example application.

### Linux
The Linux target is usually built using a complete toolchain, which helps
setting most of the environment variables required for cross-compilation.
In the case of a Yocto SDK/toolchain for example, the following command will
setup $CROSS_COMPILE as well as other related environment variables:

```
source /path/to/yocto/toolchain/environment-setup-xxx
```

The local config should however define:
```
set(KERNELDIR "/path/to/linux_avb" CACHE PATH "Path to Linux kernel")
```


Build commands
--------------
Syntax is:
```
cmake . -B<build directory> -DTARGET=<target name> -DCONFIG=<config name>
make -C <build directory> install
```

The GenAVB/TSN stack also provides a couple shell functions with auto-completion
to facilitate the build process.
Usage is
```
# Setup environment, see Build paragraph above
source environment-genavb
make_genavb [target] [config_list]
clean_genavb [target]
```
where target and config_list are optional. If no config_list is defined, all available
configurations for specified target are built. If no target is specified the default
is linux_imx6.
config_list is of the form: configA configB ..., with one or more members.

To generate doxygen HTML documentation:
```
cmake . -B<build directory> -DTARGET=<target name> -DCONFIG=<config name>
make -C <build directory> doc_doxygen
```

The generated documentation is available under `<build_directory>/doc`
To install documentation under a custom path: use cmake variable `-DDOC_OUTPUT_DIR=<custom absolute path>`

### Generated binaries
The generated binaries are installed under `<build directory>/`

### Installing binaries to target

#### Linux
Copy the content of `<build directory>/target/` to the root directory of the target filesystem

#### FreeRTOS
Refer to the FreeRTOS application README.

#### Zephyr
Refer to the Harpoon application README.
