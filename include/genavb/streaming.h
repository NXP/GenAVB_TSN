 *			After wakeup, the listener can always read batch size bytes and the talker can always write batch size bytes. This argument is updated on return with the actual configured value.
 *			In the listener case, this means the application will __never__ be woken up by the stack if the number of bytes available never reaches batch size(as can happen for example at the end of a video stream). The application should implement a time-out mechanism and make appropriate ::genavb_stream_receive \if LINUX / ::genavb_stream_receive_iov \endif calls to retrieve pending data if needed.
 * \param flags		may have the following bits set:
 * * ::AVTP_NONBLOCK to have the send/receive functions return immediately with the currently available data, even if it less than requested. If this flag is not set, the function call will block until all requested data is received or transmitted.
 * 			Blocking mode hasn't been implemented yet, so the send/receive functions will always behave in non-blocking mode.
