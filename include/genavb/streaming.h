							That works out to around 4ms for Class B streams and 2ms for Class A.

							- All talker streams from the same SR class must be created with the same latency setting (or creation will fail).*/

The application should implement a time-out mechanism and make appropriate ::genavb_stream_receive/::genavb_stream_receive_iov calls to retrieve pending data if needed.

 * * ::AVTP_NONBLOCK to have the send/receive functions return immediately with the currently available data, even if it less than requested. If this flag is not set, the function call will block until all requested data is received or transmitted.
 * 			Blocking mode hasn't been implemented yet, so the send/receive functions will always behave in non-blocking mode.
