 * the first genavb_event of a batch. If ::AVTP_PACKET_LOST is set, event_data will be used to store the amount of bytes lost.
 *
 * Send events:
 * * ::AVTP_SYNC can be set to synchronize batch transmit/avtp timestamp to the gptp time specified in the event ts field.
 * * ::AVTP_FLUSH can be set as the first event to flush all stream data, up to the end of the data being sent through the single genavb_stream_send/genavb_stream_send_iov call that will include that event.
 * * ::AVTP_FRAME_END can be set as the first event to signal that the last byte of the data being sent corresponds to the end of a frame (e.g end of a NALU in a CVF H264 stream). This will have the same effect as ::AVTP_FLUSH also.
